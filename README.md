# QA Automation Practice – Mahima Adhikari

This repository contains sample automation test scripts created to demonstrate my understanding of end-to-end test automation concepts using Cypress.

The focus of this repository is to showcase how automated tests are structured, written, and maintained alongside manual testing practices. The test cases cover common real-world scenarios such as authentication, negative validation, and basic user flows.

## Tools & Framework
- Cypress
- JavaScript
- End-to-End Testing

## Test Scenarios Covered
- Login with valid credentials
- Login with invalid credentials
- Basic cart flow
- Validation and error handling

> Note: These scripts are written for demonstration purposes using a sample application and do not contain any confidential or production data.
